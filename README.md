    - I use GitHub for mostly harnessing my programming and research skills to contribute to important projects. 

- 📖✍️ **I read a lot. I write a lot.**
  - I read research papers, news articles and non-fiction books.
  - In my free (and in my not-so-free time), I write on blogs, magazines, forums, and on all platforms where my written voice can be shared and flourish.
  - I write under pseudonyms for anonymity, and for the purpose of containing my audience at their respective niche.

- 💻 **Programming as an Hobby, and building projects for fun**
  - My primary programming languages include **Python**, **Lua**, **C/C++** and **Javascript**
  - For my research, I work with **R**, **LaTeX** and **Matlab**
      
- 💡 **Believes in the power of open-source projects that induce collaboration and community-driven initiatives.**
    - Open Source and Collaboration catalyse the rate of advancements.
    - This is true for  both the technical and academic fields.


- 🌱 **Constantly learning and striving to improve.**
    - "Who isn't?" one may ask.
    - "I am better at being inherently curious" I will respond.

My interest changes and evolve with time. I experiment alot with languages and tech stack, so expect this section to get updated every now and then.

Here are few technical skills which I currently possess:
- **Frontend**: HTML5 / CSS3, React
- **Backend** - Python, Lua, NodeJS
- **Database** - MySQL
- **Unix** - Debian and Ubuntu
- **Research** - R, Matlab, LaTex, Markdown 
- **CLI** - Bash / Shell Scripts

The Tech and Open Source Community buzzes all the time with innovations, news, surprises, drama and (at times) advancements. I just my hands dirty and play alot.

As mentioned before, I experiment alot. I have listed the software — both Open Source and Closed — that I  use every now and then: 


| Purpose         | Tools                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Programming      | NeoVim, VSCode, Sublime, Jupyter, Quarto                           |
| Media Editing   | Adobe Tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, etc.), Inkscape |
| 3d and CAD      | Blender, Solidwork                                                 |
| Game Dev        | GoDot                                                              |
| Notetaking      | Obsidian, LaTeX, MSOffice, Google Workspace Tools                  |
| Virtual Machine | VMWare Workstation Pro                                             |
| Research        | Zotero, LaTeX, R Studio, Jupyter                                   

I usually use these tools in conjunction, even though this seems like an exhaustive list. This is not a complete list, obviously, for I am quite fuzzy about working with many tools. 

For example, you can see I have more than one type of text editors for programming. But each have their own uses. For example, Neovim is primary for programming, but VSCode is quite cood for collaborating programming. Sublime quite suprisingly fast to run in small portable non-cli environment.




 

## Closing Thoughts

All the tools and skills mentioned here play a great role in my research, learning and programming endeavours. This is not a complete list since I work a lot with projects every now and then. I regularly try out new applications and get rid of the old ones.

This is common in the digital front — new application comes, and old applications go.
