## About Me
- ‚öõÔ∏è **I am an avid learner and researcher**.
    - Though I use GitHub for mostly harnessing my programming and research skills to contribute to important projects, my life does lie beyond programming and research (I have an interesting life. But for an outsider, it is boring as hell. Yup, I'm _almost_ a nerd)
- üìñ‚úçÔ∏è **I read a lot. I write a lot.**
  - I read research papers, news articles and non-fiction books.
  - In my free (and not-so-free time), I write on blogs, magazines, forums, and on all platforms where my written voice can be shared and flourish.
  - I write under pseudonyms for anonymity, and for the purpose of containing my audience on the  respective niche and community I am writing for.
- üå± **Constantly learning and striving to improve.**
    - "Who isn't?" one may ask.
    - "I am better and inherently curious" I will respond.
- üí° **Believes in the power of open-source projects that induce collaboration and community-driven initiatives.**
    - Open Source and Collaboration catalyse the rate of advancements.
    - This is true for  both the technical and  academic fields.
- ü§ù **Reach out** for any queries/feedback/communication

## Closing Thoughts

All the tools and skills mentioned here play a great role in my research, learning and programming endeavours. This is not a complete list since I work a lot with open-source projects every now and then. I regularly try out new applications and get rid of the old ones. This is common in the Open Source front ‚Äî new application comes, and old applications go.

 <b> <i> But the best ones stay. And I aspire to be one... </i> </b> </div>
